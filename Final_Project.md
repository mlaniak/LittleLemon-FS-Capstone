## Providing Feedback
As a reviewer, you will be required to provide feedback on assignments submitted by two of your peers.

The focus of your feedback should be on the functionality of the app.

Follow the prompts and look for the expected output. If you notice any errors in the functionality of any of the elements of the capstone project, you will have the opportunity to provide guidance to your peers on how they might fix the error.

An example of good feedback would be:

The project contained all of the actions expected. However, it was not possible to generate an authorization token to test the API. I would suggest reviewing this section.
